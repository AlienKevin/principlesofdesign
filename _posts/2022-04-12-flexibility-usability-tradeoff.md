The flexibility-usability tradeoff is related to the well-known maxim, jack of all trades,master of none. Flexible designs can perform more functions than specializeddesigns, but they perform the functions less efficiently. Flexible designs are, bydefinition, more complex than inflexible designs, and as a result are generally moredifficult to use. For example, a Swiss Army Knife has many attached tools thatincrease its flexibility. These tools taken together are less usable and efficient thancorresponding individual tools that are more specialized but provide a flexibility ofuse not available from any single tool. The flexibility-usability tradeoff exists becauseaccommodating flexibility entails satisfying a larger set of design requirements, which invariably means more compromises and complexity in the design.

It is a common assumption that designs should always be made as flexible aspossible. However, flexibility has real costs in terms of complexity, usability, time,and money; it generally pays dividends only when an audience cannot clearlyanticipate its future needs. For example, personal computers are flexible devicesthat are difficult to use, relative to more specialized devices like video game players.However, the primary value of a personal computer is that it addresses uncertaintyabout how it can and will be used: word processing, tax preparation, email. Peoplepurchase video game players to play games, but they purchase personal computersto satisfy a variety of needs, many of which are unknown at the time of purchase.

The ability of an audience to anticipate future uses of a product is a key indicator ofhow they will value flexibility versus usability in design. When an audience can clearlyanticipate its needs, more specialized designs that target those needs will be favored.When an audience cannot clearly define its needs, more flexible designs that enable people to address future contingencies will be favored. The degree to which anaudience can or cannot define future needs should correspond to the degree ofspecialization or flexibility in the design. As an audience comes to understand therange of possible needs that can be satisfied, their needs become better definedand, consequently, the designs need to become more specialized. This shift fromflexibility toward specialization over time is a general pattern observed in the evolutionof all systems, and should be considered in the life cycle of products.

The flexibility-usability tradeoff has implications for weighing the relative importance of flexibility versus usability in a design. When an audience has a clear understanding of its needs, favor specialized designs that target those needs as efficiently as possible. When an audience has a poor understanding of its needs,favor flexible designs to address the broadest possible set of future applications.When designing multiple generations of products, consider the general shift towardspecialization as audience needs become more defined.
